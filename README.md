# FdF_42
 FdF stands for "Fil de Fer" (Wireframe) and it is a graphical project that involves creating a 3D wireframe representation of a landscape based on height maps.
 
# Bresenham's Algorithm 
Imagine you have a piece of graph paper and you want to draw a straight line between two points on the paper. Bresenham's Algorithm is like a clever strategy that helps you decide which squares on the paper to fill in to create the line.

By using Bresenham's Algorithm, the FdF project can efficiently draw lines between the points, avoiding the need to calculate and plot every single pixel along the line. The algorithm works by making decisions based on the slope of the line and the position of pixels to determine which pixels to light up, resulting in a straight line approximation.

# Isometric projection

In the FdF project, the map represents a terrain or landscape with different elevation levels. By applying isometric projection, the project aims to display the map in a visually appealing and intuitive manner. Without isometric projection, the map would appear flat and lose the depth and dimensionality necessary for understanding its structure.

understanding isometric projection allows the program to transform the map's coordinates and display them in a visually pleasing way. It ensures that the elevation levels are properly represented, and the lines connecting the points follow the correct angles and perspectives, creating the illusion of depth.
